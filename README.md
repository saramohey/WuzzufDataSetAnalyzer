# Overview



## DAO Constructor
 * Takes the dataset file path as argument 
 * Reads the data as RDD : Assigns a string RDD holding the dataset in the csv file to the class attribute "jobs"
 * Cleans the data : Removes entries with null values and the header
 * Splits RDD to separate Table columns and trim spaces
 * Mines the data in the columns.
 * Merge columns in one tablesaw Table and assign it's value to the class attribute "DataSetTable"


## Data reading and cleaning:

* For data reading we used spark rdd.
* For cleaning, a mix between rdd and tablesaw.

### filterByExperience function:

* Function takes size as input.
* Extracts n from YearsExp column written as "n Yrs of Exp" .
* Converts n List into integer column "Numeric YearsExp" .
* Appends "Numeric YearsExp" column to the table .
* Calls filterTable() to return a table that holds "Numeric YearsExp" versus count and print it in the console.
* Extract table columns as lists and create a hash map using MakeMapFromLists() function
* returns the map

### filterBySkills function:

* Function takes size as input.
* Collects all skills in one list.
* Forms a string column "skills" from the list .
* Create a table with two columns ("skills" and "Count")

* returns the map

### makeBarChart & makePieChart functions:

* Function takes 2 lists, size, the first list is string and the second is Integer.
* size specifies the number of wanted entries.
* Ex: size = 10 >> draw only 10 entires.
* Make the charts and saves it as Png in the /out folder.



## Web Service:

Using spring boot Application to create a server:
* The server runs on port 3030. If you want to change it, change the application.properties file.
* Using Rest controller.
